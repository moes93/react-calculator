React Calculator
This is a simple calculator app built with React. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also supports clearing the input, deleting digits, and evaluating expressions.

Getting Started
To run this calculator locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calculator.git
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project folder:

shell
Copy code
cd react-calculator
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

shell
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Run the App: Start the development server to run the app:

shell
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
The app should now be running locally and can be accessed in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

How to Use
Digit Buttons: Click on the digit buttons (0-9) to input numbers. You can also use the decimal point (.) for floating-point numbers.

Operation Buttons: Click on the operation buttons (+, -, *, รท) to choose an operation. You can chain multiple operations together.

AC (All Clear) Button: Clicking this button will clear all input and reset the calculator.

DEL (Delete) Button: Removes the last digit or character from the input.

Equals (=) Button: Calculates the result of the expression and displays it in the output area.

Customization
You can customize the calculator's appearance or functionality by modifying the CSS in the App.css file or by extending the functionality in the React components.

Code Structure
App.js: The main component that represents the calculator's UI. It uses the useReducer hook for state management and defines the calculator's behavior.

DigitButton.js: A component for digit buttons (0-9) that dispatch actions to add digits to the input.

OperationButton.js: A component for operation buttons (+, -, *, รท) that dispatch actions to choose an operation.

State Management
The useReducer hook is used for managing the calculator's state. State transitions are defined in the reducer function, making it a predictable way to manage complex state logic.
